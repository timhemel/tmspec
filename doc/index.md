# TMSpec

TMSpec lets you specify a data flow diagram of an architecture, annotate it with properties, such as trust zones and technologies, and analyze the model according to (customizable) rules.
It is completely text based, letting you store the threat model in version control and run the analysis from scripts. This makes it easy to fit in a DevOps environment or CI/CD pipeline.

## How does it work?

TODO, illustrate with an example.
